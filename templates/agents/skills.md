## Agent skills

The org's procedures ship as the Claude Code plugin **`swarm-routing`**, from
[`swarm-routing/skills`](https://github.com/swarm-routing/skills). This
repository's `.claude/settings.json` enables it, so Claude Code offers a skill
when the task matches its description. Other agents (Codex, Cursor, Copilot, …)
install the same skills with `npx skills add swarm-routing/skills`
([skills.sh](https://skills.sh)). A skill is the procedure; the script does the
work and runs without it (golden rule 9), so an agent without the skill starts
from the script; so does a session that does not read this repository's
settings (some hosted sessions with several repositories do not). If Claude
Code says the plugin is missing (it was called
`org-repo` before 2026-11-09, and a cached marketplace keeps the old list), run
`claude plugin marketplace update swarm-routing` and start a new session.

| Task | Script (any agent) | Skill |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| Bring this repository onto the org templates, or fix their drift | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/org-sync/org_sync.py` | `org-repo` |
| Write or review a protocol's paper-fidelity sheet (`docs/fidelity.md`) | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/fidelity/fidelity.py` | `fidelity-sheet` |
| Check a diff against the org golden rules before a PR or a review | `swarm-routing/.github` `tools/protocol-review/check_invariants.py` | `protocol-review` |

A skill only this repository uses lives in its own `.claude/skills/`; a skill
two repositories need moves to the plugin. Skills that manage the private papers
library (finding, citing and extracting papers) stay in `swarm-routing/papers`;
a public skill may point to them, never carry library content. This section is managed by org-sync: add
a row in `swarm-routing/.github` `templates/agents/skills.md`, not here (an edit
here is undone by the next `org_sync.py apply`).
