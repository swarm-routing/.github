- Issues follow the org taxonomy ([CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues), from
  [AntHocNet ADR-0013](https://github.com/danieljoppi/AntHocNet/blob/main/docs/adr/0013-track-bugs-and-findings-as-issues.md)): one type label
  (`bug`/`enhancement`/`chore`/`documentation`/`verification`, plus `epic` for
  umbrellas), area label(s) (`protocol`/`adapter`/`ns3`/`benchmark`/
  `observability`/`packaging`/`learn-site`/`literature`), one `model:*`
  recommendation, one `priority:P1|P2|P3` on non-epic issues, a
  `release:vX.Y.Z` label only when a roadmap gates the issue. Labels come from
  `labels.json` via the `sync-labels` workflow.
- Issue bodies: **Context** (evidence, numbers, links) · **Scope** ·
  **Acceptance criteria** (checkboxes) · **Depends on** (cross-repo form
  `swarm-routing/<repo>#N`) · **References**. Children of an epic say "Part of
  #N" and are linked as sub-issues. Comments you post end with the Claude Code
  footer.
- Issues migrated from AntHocNet carry `migrated` and start with *Migrated from
  `danieljoppi/AntHocNet#N`*.
- Epics are listed where contributors look: this README's `## Epics` section
  and the org [ROADMAP](https://github.com/swarm-routing/.github/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#epics)
  are generated from the issues labelled `epic` by `swarm-routing/.github`'s
  `tools/epics/epics.py`, which reads each status from the sub-issues
  (Planned, In progress, Done). When you open or close an epic, or close the
  first or last of its sub-issues, refresh them in that PR or the next one:
  `python3 ../.github/tools/epics/epics.py readme .` here, `roadmap
  ROADMAP.md` and `profile profile/README.md` in `.github`. Never edit a
  generated section by hand; a weekly check in `.github` reports drift.
- Make minimal, reviewable changes; update the relevant doc/ADR when you change
  a documented decision.
